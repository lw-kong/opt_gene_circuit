# opt_gene_circuit
A small program to optimize gene circuit parameters for adaptation.

My environment during coding: python 3.8, tensorflow 2.3.


iffl.txt and nfb.txt are two lists of gene circuits selected by Shi, W., Ma, W., Xiong, L., Zhang, M., & Tang, C. (2017). Adaptation with transcriptional regulation. Scientific reports, 7(1), 1-11.

Figure: An example of an optimized gene circuit's response curve (red dashed curve). The circuit has a low-level response in the beginning, a high peak immediately after the input signal is switched (the vertical blue dashed line), and finally, an adaptation back to around the initial state.
